# Industrial Automation Final Project

This project simulates a supervisory system for measuring temperature and humidity in an industrial environment to control exhaust fans and air conditioners.

**Important**: It is under development for my finalization work on my specialization in industrial process automation, so it is not advisable to use it in a production environment yet.
